# AJAX

1. Using <a href="http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com">JSONPlaceholder Fake API</a>, you're required to do the following:
	
	* Make an ajax request using the URL format: <em>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/:id</em> to get and display some basic info (name, email & website) about User 1 on your html page
   * Make another ajax request to get all the posts made by User 1 and append them to your html page
  
2. Let's play around with some APIs. Using <a href="https://openweathermap.org/forecast5">Open Weather Map Forecast API</a>, make an ajax request to get and display the weather forecast in Cairo for the next couple of hours.
    Hint: Cairo's id is 360630
